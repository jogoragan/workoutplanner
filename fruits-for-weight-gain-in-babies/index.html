Make sure to remove any seeds, skin, or pits that may pose a choking hazard.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Incorporating Fruits into Baby's Diet</h2><p>Incorporating fruits into baby's diet can be a challenge, especially if they are picky eaters. Here are some tips to make the process easier:</p><h3>Tip 1: Mix Fruits with Other Foods</h3><p>You can mix fruits with other healthy foods such as yogurt, cereals, or oatmeal to make them more appealing to your baby. This will also add extra nutrients to their diet.</p><h3>Tip 2: Offer Fruits as Snacks</h3><p>You can offer fruits as snacks throughout the day instead of as a meal. This will give your baby the opportunity to try different fruits and textures.</p><h3>Tip 3: Be Creative</h3><p>Try different recipes and combinations to keep your baby interested in fruits. You can also add spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg to enhance the flavor.</p><h2 id="solution">Best Fruits for Weight Gain in Babies</h2><p>Now that you know how to incorporate fruits into your baby's diet, let's take a look at the best fruits for weight gain:</p><h3>1.
