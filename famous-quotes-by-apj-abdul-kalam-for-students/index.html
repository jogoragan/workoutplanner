Kalam was not only a renowned scientist but also a great teacher and motivator. He has left behind a wealth of wisdom through his speeches and writings, which can inspire students to achieve their goals and follow their dreams. In this article, we've compiled some of his famous quotes that every student should keep in mind.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#quote1">"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</a></li><li><a href="#quote2">"You have to dream before your dreams can come true."</a></li><li><a href="#quote3">"Thinking should become your capital asset, no matter whatever ups and downs you come across in your life."</a></li><li><a href="#quote4">"All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents."</a></li><li><a href="#quote5">"Your best teacher is your last mistake."</a></li><li><a href="#quote6">"Don't take rest after your first victory because if you fail in the second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck."</a></li><li><a href="#quote7">"To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal."</a></li><li><a href="#quote8">"We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us."</a></li><li><a href="#quote9">"The best way to predict your future is to create it."</a></li><li><a href="#quote10">"If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun."</a></li></ul><h2 id="quote1">"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</h2><p>This quote by Kalam emphasizes the importance of dreaming big. It's only when you have a dream that you can work towards achieving it. Dreams can inspire you and give you the motivation to work hard. But it's not enough to just dream, you need to turn those dreams into thoughts and then into action. This means setting goals and working towards them every day.</p><h2 id="quote2">"You have to dream before your dreams can come true."</h2><p>This quote is similar to the previous one, but it emphasizes the fact that dreams need to be followed by action. You can't just sit around waiting for your dreams to come true. You need to take action and work towards them. This means setting goals and working hard to achieve them. Only then can your dreams become a reality.</p><h2 id="quote3">"Thinking should become your capital asset, no matter whatever ups and downs you come across in your life."</h2><p>This quote by Kalam emphasizes the importance of thinking. Your thoughts and ideas are your most valuable asset. No matter what challenges you face in life, your ability to think and come up with solutions will determine your success. This means developing a positive mindset and constantly working on improving your thinking skills.</p><h2 id="quote4">"All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents."</h2><p>This quote is a reminder that talent is not the only thing that determines success. Hard work and dedication can make up for lack of talent. Everyone has the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. It's up to you to take advantage of those opportunities and work towards your goals.</p><h2 id="quote5">"Your best teacher is your last mistake."</h2><p>Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process. Instead of being afraid of making mistakes, embrace them and use them as an opportunity to learn. Kalam believed that our mistakes teach us valuable lessons and help us grow. So don't be afraid to make mistakes, just make sure you learn from them.</p><h2 id="quote6">"Don't take rest after your first victory because if you fail in the second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck."</h2><p>This quote is a reminder that success is not a one-time event. You can't just rest on your laurels after your first victory. You need to keep working hard and striving for success. If you fail, don't give up. Learn from your mistakes and keep pushing forward.</p><h2 id="quote7">"To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal."</h2><p>If you want to achieve something, you need to be completely dedicated to it. You can't let anything distract you from your goal. This means setting priorities and making sacrifices. It also means being willing to work hard and persevere even when things get tough.</p><h2 id="quote8">"We should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us."</h2><p>This quote is a reminder to never give up. No matter how difficult a problem may seem, you can always find a solution if you keep trying. Kalam believed that we should never let our problems defeat us. Instead, we should face them head-on and work towards finding a solution.</p><h2 id="quote9">"The best way to predict your future is to create it."</h2><p>Your future is not predetermined. You have the power to create the future you want. This means setting goals and taking action to achieve them. Don't just sit back and wait for things to happen, take control of your life and make things happen.</p><h2 id="quote10">"If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun."</h2><p>If you want to achieve greatness, you need to be willing to work hard and make sacrifices. Success doesn't come easy, it takes hard work and dedication. This quote by Kalam is a reminder that you need to be willing to put in the work if you want to achieve your goals.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>APJ Abdul Kalam was a great teacher and motivator who left behind a wealth of wisdom through his speeches and writings. His quotes are a great source of inspiration for students who are looking to achieve their goals and follow their dreams. By keeping these quotes in mind and working hard towards their goals, students can achieve great success in their lives.</p></article>
