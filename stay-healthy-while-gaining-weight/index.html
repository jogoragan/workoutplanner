Aim to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night.</p><h3>3. Manage Stress</h3><p>Stress can lead to health problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Managing stress is essential for staying healthy while gaining weight. Some ways to manage stress include exercise, meditation, and deep breathing.</p><h3>4.
