By starting your day with exercise, you\u0027re more likely to make healthier choices throughout the day, such as choosing healthier foods and being more active overall. Second, it helps you wake up and feel energized. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters that can help you feel more awake and alert.

Here are some tips for getting started: - Set a goal: Whether it\u0027s to run a 5k or simply to exercise three times a week, having a goal can help you stay motivated. - Find a workout buddy: Having a friend to exercise with can make it more fun and keep you accountable. - Choose an activity you enjoy: If you hate running, don\u0027t force yourself to do it. Find an activity you enjoy, such as yoga or swimming. - Start small: If you\u0027re new to exercise, start with just 10-15 minutes a day and gradually work your way up. - Create a routine: Make exercise a part of your daily routine by setting aside a specific time each day to do it. \u003ch2\u003e 3.
